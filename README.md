# CVIP-DataScience
This repository "CVIP-DataScience" contains all the source codes and dataset(s) used as part of my internship at CodersCave from 16 September 2023 to 16 October 2023 as a Data Science intern.

## Task 1  Global Terrorism Analysis
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal factors that contribute to terrorist activities.

Dataset: The dataset for the Global Terrorism Analysis was taken from Kaggle and the link is given below.
